# Gravity-anomaly-denoising-using-Advanced-Non-Local-Means
This is the README.txt for applying the Advanced Non-Local Means (ANLM) to denoise gravity anomaly:
1.I uploaded 9 files including 4 MATLAB files (in ".m") and 5 raw data file (in ".txt").
2. The main function for ANLM can be found in "NLM_II.m", detailed parameter description are involved in theis program.
3. "NLM_PotentialField_model_test.m" presents a complete case of denoising using ANLM.
4. Users can open the "NLM_PotentialField_model_test.m" and click the "run" button in MATLAB to launch the test (make sure the MATLAB is already installed).
